# Pandas-Portfolio

This repository is a display of the out-of-class work I did for Econ 690: Data Analytics for Economists.

The work is all in Python using multiple packages, including: Pandas, Matplotlib, Geopandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Shapely, Datetime, and Scikit.

There are two take-home exams, and a final project. The full final project with my report can also be found in the Chicago-Crime repository
