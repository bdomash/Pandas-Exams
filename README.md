# Pandas-Portfolio

This repository is a display of the work I did for Econ 690: Data Analytics for Economists.

The work is all in Python using multiple packages, including: Pandas, Matplotlib, Geopandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Shapely, Datetime, and Scikit.

There are multiple exercises, two take-home exams, and a final project
